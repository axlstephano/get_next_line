DON'T THINK SORRY'S EASILY SAID
DONa'T TRY TURNING TABLES INSTEAD
YOU'VE TAKEN LOTS OF CHANCES BEFORE
BUT AIN'T GONNA GIVE ANIMORE
DON'T ASK ME
THAT'S HOW IT GOES
CAUSE PART OF ME KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE THINKIN'
DON'T SAY WORDS YOU'RE GONNA REGRET
DON'T LET THE FIRE RUSH TO YOUR HEAD
I'VE HEARD THE ACCUSATIONS BEFORE
AND I AIN'T GONNA TAKE ANIMORE
BELIVE ME
THE SUN IN YOUR EYES
MADE SOME OF THE LIES WORTH BELIVING
I AM THE EYE IN THE SKY
LOOKING AT YOU
I CAN READ YOUR MIND
I AM THE MAKER OF RULES
DEALING WITH FOOLS
I CAN CHEAT YOU BLIND
AND I DON'T NEED TO SEE ANY MORE
TO KNOW THAT
I CAN READ YOUR MIND, I CAN READ YOUR MIND
DON'T LEAVE FALSE ILLUSIONS BEHIND
DON'T CRY CAUSE I AIN'T CHANGING MY MIND
SO FIND ANOTHER FOOL LIKE BEFORE
CAUSE I AIN'T GONNA LIVE ANY MORE BELIVING
SOME OF THE LIES WHILE ALL OF THE SIGNS ARE DECEIVING
I AM THE EYE IN THE SKY
LOOKING AT YOU
I CAN READ YOUR MIND
I AM THE MAKER OF RULES
DEALING WITH FOOLS
I CAN CHEAT
YOU BLIND
AND I DON'T NEED TO SEE ANY MORE
TO KNOW THAT
I CAN READ YOUR MIND, I CAN READ YOUR MIND
